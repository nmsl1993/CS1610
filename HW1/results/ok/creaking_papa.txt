creaking Papa strike living hungry man
death unwillingly bore summer
dinner jazz kitchenette eat things die

kitchen strike college bore
table twang cold living angry sweet fall
life bore chicks very thin two

tobacco very very twirl dangerous young table scraped spring
dissonant twinkling some husband strike
chicks all very thin brown kitchenette

husband clearly dry table sing table consult
kitchenette clearly twirl sweet alone bore twirling syrupy marbles lurk
angry receipts very jazz creaking things twirl

kitchenette jazz life
lovers sing
babies all twirl marbles thin dinner

bell unwillingly jazz kitchenette clearly twang woman
